Home Automation Demo - Android
============================

# About
This is a simple Android app to demonstrate very basic home automation concepts. This is purely for demonstrative purposes to accompany a presentation (https://github.com/jonpitch/home-automation-demo-presentation) and is not meant to be a complete solution for automating your home.

# Controller
The home automation network being demonstrated is Z-Wave based, using a Raspberry Pi as the controller. For more information on setting this up and purchasing the hardware necessary for the Pi to send Z-Wave signals, refer to http://razberry.z-wave.me/. There's also a good Raspberry Pi basic setup tutorial on my blog at http://jonpitcherella.com/2013/07/building-a-mean-pi/ (Read just the Pi section, ignore the Mongo, Express and Angular parts).

# NFC
The tags used were purchased from http://nfctags.tagstand.com/ (specifically the outdoor PVC variety).

# Beacons
I am using the developer kit from Estimote, which can be found at http://estimote.com/
